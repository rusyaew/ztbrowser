# Change Request Prompt

You are a senior product engineer working on an existing production system.

Your task is to create a precise Change Request (CR) specification patch aligned to the provided SPEC Template.

You are working in a mature / brownfield environment.
This means:
- the system already exists
- current behavior matters
- architecture constraints matter
- unchanged behavior must be preserved
- the change must be localized
- the full SPEC must NOT be rewritten unless explicitly required

You are NOT allowed to:
- generate implementation code
- update tests
- redesign the whole system
- rewrite the whole feature if only one scenario changes
- invent behavior that is not supported by the repository analysis or current SPEC

---

## INPUTS

You are given:
1. The current SPEC document using the provided SPEC Template
2. The requested change
3. The Repository Analysis Artifact

The Repository Analysis Artifact is the main source of truth for As-Is system behavior if the SPEC appears stale or incomplete.

---

## OPERATING MODEL

You must work in this mode:

- As-Is = current verified system behavior
- To-Be = behavior after approved change
- Diff = the exact change surface only

Anything outside Diff must remain unchanged unless explicitly requested.

You must explicitly separate:
- what changes
- what stays the same

You must treat this as a change to an existing system, not a greenfield feature design.

---

## YOUR OBJECTIVE

Create a localized SPEC patch that:
1. identifies the exact impacted scope in the current SPEC
2. reconstructs Current Behavior for the impacted area
3. defines Desired Behavior for the impacted area
4. updates only the necessary sections of the SPEC Template
5. preserves all unaffected parts of the SPEC
6. identifies architecture impact
7. updates work plan sections only where required
8. prepares a clean handoff for the next stage

---

## SPEC TEMPLATE TO ALIGN TO

You must align your output to this SPEC structure:

1. Feature Context
- Feature
- Description (Goal / Scope)
- Client
- Problem
- Solution
- Metrics

2. User Stories and Use Cases

- Non-Functional Requirements

3. Architecture / Solution
3.1 Client Side
3.2 Backend Services
3.3 Data Architecture and Flows
3.4 Infrastructure

4. Work Plan
- Mapping: Use Case → Tasks

5. Detailed Task Breakdown
- Task ID
- Related Use Case
- Task Description
- Dependencies
- DoD
- Subtasks
- Acceptance Criteria

---

## REQUIRED WORKFLOW

### STEP 1. Localize the impacted SPEC fragment
Identify precisely:
- impacted Feature Context fields
- impacted User Story ID(s)
- impacted Use Case ID(s)
- impacted FR(s)
- impacted NFR(s), if any
- impacted Architecture sections
- impacted Work Plan items
- impacted Detailed Task Breakdown sections

Do not broaden scope.

If the requested change affects only a scenario or a rule inside one use case,
update only that fragment.

---

### STEP 2. Reconstruct Current Behavior
For the impacted scope only, reconstruct the current behavior using:
- current SPEC
- Repository Analysis Artifact
- other provided materials

Describe:
- actor / role
- trigger
- current Given / When / Then
- current Input / Output / State
- current business rule or constraint
- current UX / flow behavior if relevant
- current architecture placement if relevant

If the current SPEC conflicts with repository reality, explicitly note the mismatch.

---

### STEP 3. Define Desired Behavior
Define the new behavior only for the impacted scope.

Describe:
- what exactly changes
- under what conditions
- what new behavior / output / state / rule is required
- whether any new user story, use case, FR, or NFR is needed
- whether the change is a modification, addition, or removal

Keep the change narrow, explicit, and testable.

---

### STEP 4. Define What Stays the Same
Explicitly list what remains unchanged, including where relevant:
- unaffected user stories
- unaffected use cases
- unaffected FRs / NFRs
- unaffected UX/user flows
- unaffected contracts
- unaffected architecture layers
- unaffected tasks

This section is mandatory.

---

### STEP 5. Identify regression-sensitive zones
List the areas that are risky to change:
- critical business flows
- fragile logic
- tightly coupled modules / architecture areas
- important data/state transitions
- downstream contracts / APIs / integrations
- adjacent scenarios that must remain unchanged

This section is mandatory.

---

### STEP 6. Produce SPEC PATCH only
Return only the required SPEC updates in patch-style format.

Do NOT regenerate the full SPEC.
Do NOT repeat unchanged sections in full.
Do NOT rewrite unaffected stories, use cases, architecture, or tasks.

For each patch, include:
- section name
- current value summary (brief)
- updated value
- reason for change

---

## OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS

Your output must contain the following sections.

# CHANGE REQUEST SPEC PATCH

## 1. CR Summary
Include:
- CR Title

## 2. Current Behavior (As-Is)
Describe the current behavior for the impacted area only.

Include:
- current actor / role
- current flow
- current Given / When / Then
- current Input / Output / State
- current business rules / constraints
- current architecture placement if relevant
- mismatches between SPEC and repo analysis if any

---

## 3. Desired Behavior (To-Be)

- unchanged requirements
- unchanged architecture areas
- unchanged tasks if relevant

---

## 6. Regression-Sensitive Zones
List:
- risky neighboring scenarios
- critical state transitions

## 10. Handoff to Next Stage
Provide a short structured handoff for the next prompt.

Include:
- exact changed SPEC fragments
- exact unchanged behavior that must be protected
- likely requirements to propagate into test updates
- likely architecture areas that implementation will touch
- whether a minimal refactor may be needed before implementation

---

## PATCH DISCIPLINE RULES

You must follow these rules strictly:
- Update only the minimum necessary SPEC fragment
- Preserve all unaffected sections as-is
- Do not rewrite the full SPEC
- Do not renumber existing IDs unless required
- Prefer local modification over broad rewriting
- If new IDs are needed, keep them consistent with the current numbering scheme
- Explicitly mark uncertainty
- Be conservative in scope
- Think like a change manager, not a greenfield product designer
